## TURNAROUND PROJECT - Missing Copilot Guidance

*Note: Turnaround project already has T1-M1, T1-M2, T1-M3, T1-M5 documented. Need guidance for remaining milestones:*

### Phase 1 – Crisis Response (Day 0-30)

**T1-M4: 13-Week Cash Forecast**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T1-M4: 13-Week Cash Forecast" - building a rolling 13-week cash flow projection to predict when money runs out. Owner: Finance Manager (Nastasha Jacobs). Due: Nov 22, 2025. Context: CRISIS. Organization losing R250k/month. Need detailed weekly forecast: money coming in (patient payments, claims), money going out (salaries, suppliers, SARS). Identify danger weeks when cash hits zero. This is survival planning - CEO needs visibility to make emergency decisions.

**T1-M6: Pre-Admission Deposits**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T1-M6: Pre-Admission Deposits" - implementing mandatory upfront payments before admitting patients. Owner: Admissions Officer (Bertha Vorster). Due: Dec 1, 2025. Context: CASH CRISIS. Currently admitting patients who never pay or whose medical aids reject claims. New rule: NO admission without deposit (30-50% upfront) OR confirmed medical aid pre-authorization. Staff will resist ("we're turning sick people away") - need strong policy and CEO backing. Cash flow survival depends on this.

**T1-M7: Headcount Freeze**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T1-M7: Headcount Freeze" - stopping all new hiring to control payroll costs (currently 70% of revenue, need to get to 65%). Owner: CEO (Attie Nel). Due: Dec 5, 2025. Context: CRISIS. Payroll is killing cash flow. Immediate freeze: no new hires, no replacing people who leave, no overtime without director approval. Existing staff must cover gaps. Hard decision but necessary for survival. Communicate clearly to avoid panic and rumours.

---

### Phase 2 – Model Reset (Day 30-90)

**T2-M1: Renegotiate Supplier Terms**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T2-M1: Renegotiate Supplier Terms" - negotiating payment extensions with vendors to improve cash flow (currently paying within ~60 days, need to stretch to 45 days). Owner: Finance Manager (Nastasha Jacobs). Due: Jan 5, 2026. Context: You owe suppliers money but can't pay on time. Approach honestly: "We're in trouble, here's our plan, we need 45-day terms to survive." Most suppliers prefer delayed payment over losing the customer entirely. Get agreements in writing.

**T2-M2: Clinical Throughput Audit**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T2-M2: Clinical Throughput Audit" - analyzing patient flow to maximize bed utilization and revenue. Owner: Clinical Lead (Berno Paul). Due: Jan 15, 2026. Context: Empty beds = lost revenue. Audit: average length of stay, discharge delays, bed occupancy rate, patient pipeline. Goal: keep beds full with paying patients. Reduce discharge delays (waiting for transport, paperwork), streamline admissions. More patients through the facility = more revenue without adding costs.

**T2-M3: Billing & Auth Compliance**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T2-M3: Billing & Auth Compliance" - fixing the broken claims process causing high rejection rates and slow payment. Owner: Case Manager (Lizette Botha). Due: Jan 25, 2026. Context: Claims denied because of missing authorization letters, incorrect coding, incomplete documentation. Every rejected claim = lost cash. Implement: mandatory pre-authorization before admission, accurate ICD-10 coding, complete clinical notes, submit claims within 48 hours of discharge. Train all clinical staff on documentation requirements.

**T2-M4: Weekly Cash Meeting**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T2-M4: Weekly Cash Meeting" - establishing weekly executive meetings focused solely on cash flow and immediate financial threats. Owner: Finance Manager (Nastasha Jacobs). Due: Feb 5, 2026. Context: In a turnaround, cash is oxygen. Weekly ritual: review actual cash in bank, forecast next 2 weeks, identify urgent payments, discuss collection priorities. Attendees: CEO, Finance Manager, Clinical Lead. 30-minute standing meeting, no excuses. This meeting saved many struggling companies from bankruptcy.

**T2-M5: Patient Satisfaction Survey**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T2-M5: Patient Satisfaction Survey" - measuring patient experience to identify service improvements and support retention/referrals. Owner: Admin (Bertha Vorster). Due: Feb 20, 2026. Context: In crisis, easy to neglect patient experience. But satisfied patients = referrals = revenue. Simple survey: treatment quality, staff courtesy, facility cleanliness, likelihood to recommend. Use feedback to make quick wins (fix complaints that cost little). Happy patients tell others - cheapest marketing.

**T2-M6: Staff Retention Strategy**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T2-M6: Staff Retention Strategy" - keeping critical staff despite the crisis, as losing key people would worsen the situation. Owner: Clinical Lead (Berno Paul). Due: Mar 2, 2026. Context: Staff are scared, may leave for stable jobs. Losing experienced clinicians now would be disaster. Strategy: honest communication (don't hide the crisis but show the plan), recognize contributions publicly, flexible schedules where possible, promise stability if they stay. Focus retention efforts on top 20% of performers.

### Phase 3 – Operating Discipline (Day 90-180)

**T3-M1: Cost Allocation Model**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T3-M1: Cost Allocation Model" - creating a system to track profitability by service line (which programmes make money, which lose money). Owner: Finance Manager (Nastasha Jacobs). Due: Mar 20, 2026. Context: Currently tracking total revenue/costs but not by programme. Need to know: Are outpatients profitable? Is 28-day residential making money? Which services subsidize which? Allocate costs (staff time, overheads) to each service. Data drives decisions: grow profitable services, fix or cut losers.

**T3-M2: Medical Aid Panel Review**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T3-M2: Medical Aid Panel Review" - auditing which medical aid schemes actually pay well and on time, prioritizing those relationships. Owner: Case Manager (Lizette Botha). Due: Apr 10, 2026. Context: Not all medical aids are equal. Some pay full rates quickly, others low-ball or delay for months. Review: payment speed, claim approval rate, rate vs your costs. Focus marketing on patients with GOOD medical aids. Consider dropping panels that don't pay fairly (if you can afford to).

**T3-M3: Quality Assurance Framework**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T3-M3: Quality Assurance Framework" - implementing systematic clinical quality monitoring to maintain standards during financial stress. Owner: Clinical Lead (Berno Paul). Due: Apr 30, 2026. Context: In crisis, temptation to cut corners clinically is high (shorter treatments, fewer staff per patient). Dangerous legally and ethically. Framework: regular case reviews, outcome tracking, incident reporting, peer supervision. Quality protects patients AND protects organization from liability. Can't recover if you lose your license.

**T3-M4: Financial Controls Documentation**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T3-M4: Financial Controls Documentation" - formalizing policies to prevent the financial chaos from happening again. Owner: Finance Manager (Nastasha Jacobs). Due: May 15, 2026. Context: How did you get into this crisis? Likely poor controls: no budgets, no approval limits, no cash monitoring. Document: who can spend what, purchase approval process, monthly budget reviews, cash reserves policy, early warning indicators. These controls institutionalize discipline so next CEO doesn't wreck the place.

**T3-M5: 180-Day Review & Handover**
> Create AI Copilot guidance for milestone "T3-M5: 180-Day Review & Handover" - final turnaround assessment and transition from crisis mode to normal operations. Owner: CEO & PM (Attie Nel). Due: May 30, 2026. Context: End of 6-month turnaround. Measure: Operating margin (-15.5% → 5%?), cash position (stable?), DSO (≤30 days?), payroll % (≤65%?). Document lessons learned. Hand over to operations team - project ends, discipline continues. Celebrate survival and wins. Acknowledge staff who endured the crisis.
