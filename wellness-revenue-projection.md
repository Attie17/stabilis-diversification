## **60% Success = R150,000/month Sustainable Revenue**

At 60% success by mid-2027:
- **180 sessions/month** (vs 300 target)
- **6 school/corporate contracts** (vs 10 target)
- **R30k/month digital revenue** (vs R50k target)
- **5 behavioural addiction tracks** operating
- **20+ practitioners** contracted/employed
- **R150,000 - R180,000/month** net revenue

**12-Month Total (Jan - Dec 2026): R3,939,900**
**Average Monthly (Year 1): R328,325/month**

This projection assumes realistic ramp-up with:
- Slow start (Jan-Feb) as systems launch
- Accelerated growth (Mar-Jun) as word spreads
- Strong mid-year (Jul-Oct) as referral pipelines mature
- Sustained capacity (Nov onwards) with predictable income

Even at 60% success, this becomes a **highly profitable income stream** by Q3 2026.
