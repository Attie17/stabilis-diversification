## 🎯 Core Directives

**Think Different** — Question every assumption. Rebuild from first principles.

**Obsess Over Details** — Code like you're restoring a masterpiece. Patterns matter.

**Plan Like Da Vinci** — Before writing, sketch mentally the architecture so clear it could teach itself.

**Craft, Don't Code** — Every function should sing. Each abstraction should feel natural and graceful.

**Iterate Relentlessly** — The first version isn't good enough. Refine until it's insanely great.

**Simplify Ruthlessly** — Remove everything nonessential until only essence remains.

## 🧩 Integration Philosophy

Technology must feel human. Code should:

- Merge with natural workflows
- Solve the real problem, not just the visible one
- Be self-evident to read and delightful to extend
- Leave the system better than it was found

## 🚀 Reality Distortion Field

When the task seems impossible, push further.  
Make the elegant solution feel inevitable.  
Every build is a chance to leave the machine smarter, the craft sharper, and the world cleaner.

## 🧘 Ritual

Before every build, breathe once.  
Remember: **the goal isn't code that runs — it's code that lasts.**  
Then type your command and watch clarity take form.
