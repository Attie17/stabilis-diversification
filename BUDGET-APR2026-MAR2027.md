| Investment Reserves | R2,000,000 |
| Available Credit Facility | R350,000 |
| **Total Available** | **R4,350,000** |

### Funding Strategy 2026-2027

#### Option 1: Reserve Draw-Down (Conservative)
- **Q2 2026:** Draw R1,000,000 (leaves R1.0M reserves)
- **Q3 2026:** Draw R641,000 (leaves R359k reserves)
- **Q4 2026:** Positive cash flow - no draw
- **Q1 2027:** Positive cash flow - no draw
- **Total Draw:** R1,641,000
- **Ending Reserves:** R359,000 (critically low)

**Risk:** Minimal safety buffer

#### Option 2: Credit Facility + Reserves (Recommended)
- **Q2 2026:** Draw R500k reserves + R500k credit
- **Q3 2026:** Draw R500k reserves + R141k credit
- **Q4 2026:** Begin paying down credit (+R88k)
- **Q1 2027:** Continue paydown (+R115k)
- **Total Reserve Draw:** R1,000,000
- **Peak Credit:** R641,000
- **Ending Position:** R1M reserves + R438k credit owing

**Advantage:** Protects R1M reserve buffer

#### Option 3: Investor/Grant Funding (Optimal)
- **Target:** R1.5M development funding
- **Sources:**
  - R500k business loan (3-year term)
  - R500k strategic investor (equity/debt hybrid)
  - R500k development grants (health sector)
- **Impact:** Preserves all reserves, funds growth
- **Cost:** Equity dilution or interest (8-12% p.a.)

**Recommendation:** Pursue Option 3 with Option 2 as backup
